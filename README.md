# Using machine learning and technical analysis on stock prices predictions
*Udacity - Machine learning Nanodegree Program*

## Project Overview
Predicting the future is a challenging task from the earliest days of mankind, whether for climatic, economic, and so on. The technical analysis is a tool that was created with the purpose of helping the human being to make predictions in economic areas, although it was popularized in the 80's, it has been used since the 17th century as a tool for predicting future prices.

The use of artificial neural networks as a model of machine learning on the other hand, had its starting point in the 1940s, though it became popular only after the 2000s due to the great advance of GPUs. These algorithms nowadays are being used by machine learning engineers in the economic field as the same intention that the technical analysis is used by traders.

But, can we actually combine these two tools in order to accurately predict the stock prices? Trying to answer this question I created a predictive algorithm that uses not only the daily quotations of a company as input data, but also technical analysis indicators created from these quotations, in order to generate good predictions.
